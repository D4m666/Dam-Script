Automated Monitoring Script

To execute the script do the following commands inside the folder
  - 'chmod +x setup.sh'
  - './setup.sh'
  - 'pip install -r requirements.txt'
  - 'python main.py
 

I used two tools to make this script and the rest was all made by me.

Tools i used:
  - Glance - https://nicolargo.github.io/glances/ 
  - Iftop - https://www.tecmint.com/iftop-linux-network-bandwidth-monitoring-tool/

I dind't test the script in Windows, so im not sure if it will work.

Enjoy the Script :)
